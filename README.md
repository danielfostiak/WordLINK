## "WordLINK", Go from bored to excited in one click.

This is an educational linguistics puzzle game in which you are challenged each day to link two unrelated words via synonyms and antonyms. The reason this works is because synonyms are not exactly the same, and antonyms are not exactly the opposite, which leads to slight changes in words as you traverse. Furthermore, some words have many meanings and so can have many different synonyms/antonyms. 

Coded using Next.js and TailwindCSS.
