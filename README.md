## "WordLINK", Go from bored to excited in one click.

This is an educational linguistics puzzle game in which you are challenged each day to link two unrelated words via synonyms and antonyms. The reason this works is because synonyms are not exactly the same, and antonyms are not exactly the opposite, which leads to slight changes in words as you traverse. Furthermore, some words have many meanings and so can have many different synonyms/antonyms. 

Coded using Next.js and TailwindCSS.

*Currently, I am working on an efficient algorithm to find the shortest path between two words for each day (most likely using BFS or Dijkstra's). I am coding this in python and will make a repo very soon, to show how I am doing it. For now, we can assume that the players will find the best paths, I believe in you all!*
